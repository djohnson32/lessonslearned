###Reducing Software Entropy

The Broken Window Theory describes how if an apartment window is broken and left unrepaired, it is highly likely that vandals will break another window. As the neighborhood becomes instilled with a sense of abandonment, more and more windows will be vandalized and the situation will rapidly worsen. Given the time pressures and complexity of software development, it is easy to make concessions to the quality of software. A pragmatic programming team will fix broken windows (or, at the very minimum, comment out the offending code) in order to avoid software entropy in software development.
