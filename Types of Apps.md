#Types of Apps

When looking to create a new app, you best be informed about what your different options are...Or else!
Basically, apps can be divided into three different categories:
  * Native
  * Web (HTML 5)
  * Hybrid
  
Like the name implies, native apps live on the device and are accessed through an icon on the phone's screen. 
Users download native apps from web stores such as Apple's AppStore or Google Play.  The advantage of native
apps is they can use all of the features on the phone such as GPS or camera.  Native apps can cost significantly
more than the other options, so if you are not using your app as a social media plat form or to use the other
functions of the phone, another options might be better.

Web apps are really just websites that are optimized to look like an app on a mobile device.  Users can go to the
requested website and installing a web app that appears as an icon on their phone screen. However, the difference
is the web app serves more as an easy-to-access bookmark instead of the app being live on the device.  

Hybrid apps are a combination of the native and web app. They can be downloaded from an app store and use the functions
of a phone like a native app, but they rely on HTML being rendered on a browser that is embedded within the app. Hybrid apps
are a great option for people that already have an HTML website and are looking for a cost-effective way to make 
the app compatible across different platforms.
